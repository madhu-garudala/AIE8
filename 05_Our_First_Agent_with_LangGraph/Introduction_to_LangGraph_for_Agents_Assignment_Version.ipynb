    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",

    "**Answer to Question #4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The current `must_mention` metric has several limitations that could be improved:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Gaps:**\n",
    "1. **Case sensitivity** - The current implementation is case-sensitive, so \"peng\" wouldn't match \"Peng\"\n",
    "2. **Exact string matching** - It looks for exact substring matches, missing variations like \"Dr. Peng\" vs \"Peng\"\n",
    "3. **Binary scoring** - Returns 1.0 only if ALL phrases are found, 0.0 otherwise (no partial credit)\n",
    "4. **Context ignorance** - Doesn't consider if the phrase appears in the right context\n",
    "5. **Synonym/variation handling** - Misses related terms or different forms of names\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Improvements:**\n",
    "1. **Case-insensitive matching**: `phrase.lower() in outputs[\"answer\"].lower()`\n",
    "2. **Fuzzy matching**: Use libraries like `fuzzywuzzy` for approximate string matching\n",
    "3. **Partial scoring**: Return the percentage of required phrases found instead of binary\n",
    "4. **Semantic similarity**: Use embeddings to match semantically similar phrases\n",
    "5. **Named entity recognition**: Use NLP libraries to identify entities rather than exact strings\n",
    "6. **Regular expressions**: Handle variations in names/terms more flexibly\n",
    "7. **Context awareness**: Check if phrases appear in relevant contexts, not just anywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example improved version:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def improved_must_mention(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> float:\n",

      "Context Engineering is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that focuses on designing, managing, and optimizing the context in which systems, especially artificial intelligence and software applications, operate. It involves understanding and shaping the environment, circumstances, and background information that influence how systems behave and interact with users. The goal is to improve system performance, user experience, and decision-making by carefully engineering the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of Context Engineering has gained prominence with the rise of AI, IoT, and complex software systems, where context plays a crucial role in system effectiveness. It started to break onto the scene in the late 2010s and early 2020s, driven by advancements in contextual AI, ubiquitous computing, and the need for more adaptive and personalized systems.\n",

      "Fine-tuning is a machine learning technique used to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset. Instead of training a model from scratch, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, fine-tuning involves taking an existing model that has already learned general features from a large dataset and then further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process helps the model specialize and improve its performance on the target task while leveraging the knowledge it has already acquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine-tuning has become a prominent approach in the development of large language models, computer vision models, and other deep learning architectures. It allows researchers and developers to efficiently customize models for various applications, such as natural language processing, image recognition, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for when it \"broke onto the scene,\" fine-tuning has been around in various forms for many years, but it gained widespread popularity and recognition with the rise of large pre-trained models like BERT (introduced in 2018) and GPT (with GPT-2 in 2019 and GPT-3 in 2020). These models demonstrated the effectiveness of transfer learning and fine-tuning, leading to a significant shift in how AI models are developed and deployed.\n",

These agents can be used in applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, automated customer support, and more complex decision-making systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of LLM-based agents gained significant attention and broke onto the scene around 2020-2021, coinciding with the development and release of advanced large language models like OpenAI's GPT-3 in 2020. GPT-3's impressive capabilities demonstrated the potential of LLMs to serve as foundational components for building intelligent agents that can understand and generate human language at a high level.\n",
