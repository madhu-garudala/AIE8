    "The three-state structure (AgentState, SupervisorState, ResearcherState) splits responsibilities in a hierarchical, modular way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AgentState** holds the overall conversation, user goals, and output (i.e., the whole research project).\n",
    "- **SupervisorState** manages and coordinates the research process, including delegating tasks to multiple Researchers and tracking progress across research iterations.\n",
    "- **ResearcherState** narrows in on the work done by each individual research sub-agent: their message history, tool use, and findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not a single huge state?**  \n",
    "Dividing state this way keeps things modular, scalable, and easier to reason about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each level is only responsible for its own scope. This means you can parallelize work, swap out supervisors or researchers, and cleanly extend the pipeline.\n",
    "- It avoids “spaghetti state” where all information is mixed together; changes at one level don’t break others.\n",
    "- The hierarchy mirrors how real research teams coordinate: big-picture direction at the top, hands-on research at the bottom.\n",

    "# \n",
    "# 1. Discoverability: New users may find it harder to see underlying implementation details if they are abstracted away, requiring them to look up and open external files.\n",

    "2. **Parallel Execution**\n",

    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Research Brief\n",
    "Your request was transformed into a detailed research brief that guides the supervisor's delegation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Supervisor Delegation\n",
    "The supervisor analyzed the brief and decided how to break down the research:\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to plan strategy\n",
    "- Called `ConductResearch` multiple times to delegate to parallel researchers\n",
    "- Each delegation specified a focused research topic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Parallel Research\n",
    "Multiple researchers worked simultaneously:\n",
    "- Each researcher used web search tools to gather information\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to reflect after each search\n",
    "- Decided when they had enough information\n",
    "- Compressed their findings into clean summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 5: Final Report\n",
    "All research findings were synthesized into a comprehensive report with:\n",
    "- Well-structured sections\n",
    "- Inline citations\n",
    "- Sources listed at the end\n",

    "\n",
    "### Architecture Benefits\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Decomposition** - Research structure emerges from the question, not predefined\n",
    "2. **Parallel Efficiency** - Multiple researchers work simultaneously\n",
    "3. **ReAct Quality** - Strategic reflection improves search decisions\n",
    "4. **Scalability** - Handles token limits gracefully through compression\n",
    "5. **Flexibility** - Easy to add new tools and capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This Pattern\n",
    "- **Complex research questions** that need multi-angle investigation\n",
    "- **Comparison tasks** where parallel research on different topics is beneficial\n",
    "- **Open-ended exploration** where structure should emerge dynamically\n",
    "- **Time-sensitive research** where parallel execution speeds up results\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Section-Based Instead\n",
    "- **Highly structured reports** with predefined format requirements\n",
    "- **Template-based content** where sections are always the same\n",
    "- **Sequential dependencies** where later sections depend on earlier ones\n",
    "- **Budget constraints** where token efficiency is critical"

    "1. **Add MCP Tools** - Integrate specialized tools for your domain\n",
    "2. **Custom Prompts** - Modify prompts for specific research types\n",
    "3. **Different Models** - Try different Claude versions or mix models\n",
    "4. **Persistence** - Use a real database for checkpointing instead of memory\n",
